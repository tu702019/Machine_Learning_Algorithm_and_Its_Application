Purpose: Please kindly optimize the parameters of fuzzy systems developed in Assignment 3, and the optimization methods are not limited.

 

Deliverable:

1) A complete comparison between the original model and the optimized model.

The evaluation criterions:

For the regression problem – MAPE, MSE, RMSE, NRMSE

For the classification problem – accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure

 

2) Codes in a PDF file

Hint: Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
