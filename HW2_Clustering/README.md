Dataset: “bankruptcy” and “diamonds” (The simulation data are processed by the Assignment – 1)

You are kindly required to process the above datasets by the following clustering algorithms, including

1) Flat – K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithms

2) Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, and Average Linkage Clustering Algorithms

 

Deliverable: 

1) A complete cluster analysis for each clustering algorithm (as far as possible)

2) Codes in a PDF file

 

FYI & Hint:

a) How to computationally find the optimal value of K or C? (by which method?)

b) As the above datasets are classification and regression problems, we already had a discussion in the lecture about how to transfer these problems to the clustering problem, or inverse.
