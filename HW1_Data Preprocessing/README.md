Dataset:  

You'll only need to preprocess the“bankruptcy” and “diamonds” datasets

 

1) Null (or Missing) Values Estimation [Please fill the values without highlighting the blanks in the excel file]

2) Data Balance [Only for “classification problem”, and please state the original and final amount of each class of each dataset]

3) Feature Selection [Please state the original and final amount of features of each dataset]

4) After finishing 1) 2) 3), please save your file to .xlsx for this assignment, and save it to .csv for the next one. 



Deliverable: 

1) A brief report logically describes the algorithm, method, or thinking applied to address the above issues using PDF format.

2) Excel files.

3) Code: Please submit a PDF file and a source code with py. or .ipynb format.

 

FYI & Hint:

There are a lot of ways to fill (or estimate) the null (or missing) values in the relational database, and it is not limited to what we have discussed in the lectures.

Several feature selection methods are applied to “classification and regression problems”.
