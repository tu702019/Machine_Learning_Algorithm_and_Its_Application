Dataset: The applied dataset, “bankruptcy” and “diamonds”, are the result processed by Assignment 2.

Purpose: You are kindly required to process the above datasets by Fuzzy System Identification, and the entire procedure can be potentially stated as follows:

1) Randomly sample 10% data from the above dataset.

2) In accordance with the above samples, randomly pick out 70% for the training data and the remaining 30% for the validation data.

3) The triangular/Gaussian membership functions are assigned for the fuzzification, and the connection between the clustering result and membership function is essentially required. For example, if there are 3 clusters generated in the data, it therefore implies that each input variable (or feature) carries 3 membership functions. Furthermore, the range of cluster represents the interval (or the width) of membership function. (FYI: To decrease the dimensionality, the number of cluster is set to 2, and which can be generated by K-Means or Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. i. e., K=2 or C=2)

 

Deliverable:

1) A complete analysis, including system accuracy & computational cost (parameters and processing time), with training error and the validation error for each dataset is necessary.

The evaluation criterions:

For the regression problem – MAPE, MSE, RMSE, NRMSE

For the classification problem – accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure
